## Single Sign-On with Spring Boot, OpenID Connect and Okta

This Spring Boot application demonstrates accomplishing Single Sign-On across multiple OpenID Connect applications
with multiple Authorization Servers defined in Okta.

To use this sample application, you need to create a free developer Okta org. You can do that by going to
https://developer.okta.com.

For more detail about OpenID Connect and how to use this app, check out the blog post here (coming soon).

### Build the app

run:

```mvn clean install```

### Run the app

Included in this repo is a shell script to make it easy to run the app. It works on Mac and Linux:

```
./run_app.sh \
    --ci <client id for oidc app>  \
    --cs <client secret for oidc app> \
    --is <issuer for oidc app>
```

If you're on a different system, you can also run the app directly with maven:

```
mvn spring-boot:run \
    -Dokta.oauth2.clientId=<client id for oidc app> \
    -Dokta.oauth2.clientSecret=<client secret for oidc app> \
    -Dokta.oauth2.issuer=<issuer for oidc app>
```

You can also deploy directly to Heroku and provision an Okta org at the same time!
